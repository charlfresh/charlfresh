# What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

symmetric is where every computer involved in the sending and receving, knows the decryption key. In asymmetric encrytion, only the computer receving the message has the dycrption key.

# Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

The computer sending the message uses the public key of the person receving the message to encrypt the message. Then the person receving the message uses their private key, which only they have access to, to decrypt the message

# Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

Because then people would be able to decrypt any message being sent to you.
